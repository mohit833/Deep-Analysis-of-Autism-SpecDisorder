DEEP ANALYSIS OF AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER DETECTION TECHNIQUES
OBJECTIVE:
The aim of this project is to find out the most significant traits and 
automate the diagnosis process using available machine learning classification techniques for improved diagnosis purpose. 
We compare various machine learning algorithms for early autism detection.


ABSTRACT:
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), which is a neuro development disorder,
is often accompanied by sensory issues such an over sensitivity or under sensitivity to sounds and
smells or touch. In present day Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is gaining its momentum faster than ever. 
Detecting autism traits through screening tests is very expensive and time consuming. 
With the advancement of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML), 
autism can be predicted at quite early stage. 
The main aim of this project is to analyze various Machine learning algorithms,
used by various researcher like SVM (support Vector Machine), 
Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression and
compare the result based on their accuracy and efficiency
